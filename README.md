# V3 THEME

## 1 learn new css classes and add addional one or maps as needed. 

maps this is currently only being used for spacing and colors and will hopfully make sense from code and comments

## minimise use of divs 

This is especialy Important for parent elements shouls be section, article, aside, figure etc


## comments

put comments in php tag so they dont show up in code on frontend


## templating language

not sure if we want to use addional temokating past wordpress/php we are already using

# js
## functions

function names should be contain varbs e.g. getNewData() openNavMenu() addToText()
this will make code without comment or poor comments easier to understand at a glance

also names for js functions variables etc should be cammelCase not hyphenated or underscored or just a string with no deviderbetweenwords 
because it is hard to read and makes code harder to understand at a glance

console logs should be removed from live sites unless needed


# images

squoosh images at the start of project or when image receved.

# git 

Add Clear comments that say what files have been changed and how.
We need to be able to find the files at the point when a change is made incase we need to pull code backout of it.

--new branch per feature. not so much an issue durin inital build but for an ongoing site that is live
use a seperate branch to make updates on then push to dev/main branch once finished

# wysisyg

ongoing--- add styles as needed to default theme

# changelog 
this is a spot to add chages that wont be push to github e.g. changes to database, file permissions, maybe even tutorials followed to get something complec working
date these updates with most recent at top e.g.

13/09/2021 ---- comment about something
